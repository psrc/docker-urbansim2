# docker-urbansim2

This project creates a complete, runnable PSRC Urbansim2 virtual container, using [Docker](http://docs.docker.com). Install Docker on your machine, and you don't need anything else to run Urbansim! Neat-o.

## Docker quickstart

Docker lets you specify all the software and setup for complex systems, which makes it perfect for Urbansim. It creates a Linux "virtual machine" on your computer, and everything runs inside that container.

* [Read the docs](https://docs.docker.com) -- they're quite good.
* Install Docker Toolbox. There are several different ways to get Docker running on Windows; after some experimentation I think using Docker Toolbox is the best approach. In fall 2016 they released Docker for Windows, but it requires either Windows 10 Pro Anniversary Edition or Windows Server 2016. We have the former on our desktops, but the PSRC ModelSrv servers are running an older version of the OS. For consistency, let's just use Docker Toolbox everywhere.
